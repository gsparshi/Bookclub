            One web page for every book ever published. It's a lofty but achievable goal.

            To build Bookclub, we need hundreds of millions of book records, a wiki interface and lots of people who are willing
            to contribute their time and effort to building the site.
            To date, we have gathered over 20 million records from a variety of large catalogs
            as well as single contributions,with more on the way.
            Bookclub is an open project: the software is open, the data are open, the documentation is open,
            and we welcome your contribution. Whether you fix a typo,add a book, or write a widget--it's all welcome.
            We have a small team of fantastic programmers who have accomplished a lot,but we can't do it alone!</font></pre>

              <pre><font font-weight="bold" face="Gabriola" size="5px">   
The ultimate goal of the Bookclub is to make all the published works of humankind available to everyone in the world.
While large in scope and ambition, this goal is within our grasp. Achieving it will require the participation of librarians, authors, 
government officials and technologists.Imagine what a comprehensive, open library could be! A talented math whiz 
who lives in a rural community can explore the works of high math. 
An elderly person can have a large print edition of any book ever published. An innovative young scholar can publish 
a book directly to this great library on subjects that might not otherwise make it through the long and difficult publication process.
How can you help? Improve the records we have for the books you love – every record is fully editable by clicking the 
“edit” button on the page.If we don't have a record for a book, you can create one. If you're a library with digitized resources, 
tell us where they are and we'll point people to them.
Our hope is that libraries and individual book readers will join this project and together we can build towards universal
access to all knowledge.
