        Back in February, one of the site’s translators requested an update to the template file
        so as to begin translating some of the new text. I’d done a little developer-side
        translation work on the site already, so I was assigned to the issue. 
        I ran the script to generate the new file, and right away noticed two things:
        The process was very simple to run (a single command), and it ran very quickly.
        The update resulted in a 2,132-line change to the template file, which meant it had fallen very, very out of date.
        I pointed this out to the issue’s lead, Drini, and he mentioned that there had been talk
        of finding a way to automate the process, but they hadn’t settled on the best way to do so.
        I signed off and went to make some lunch, then ran back and suggested that the most
        efficient way to automate it would be to check whether each incoming change includes new
        changed site text, and to run the script automatically if so. He liked the idea, so I
        wrote up a proposal for it, but nothing really came of it until:</font></pre>

        <pre><font font-weight="bold" face="Gabriola" size="5px">
            In March, Drini reached back out to me with an idea about a potentially simple way to
            do the automation. Whenever a developer submits a new change they would like to make
            to the code, we run a set of automatic tests, called “pre-commit hooks,” mostly to
            make sure that their submission does not contain any typos and would not cause any
            problems if integrated into the site. 

            Since my automation idea had been to update the translation template each time a
            relevant change was made, Drini suggested that the most natural way to do that would
            be to add a quick template re-generation to the series of automated tests we already have.
            
            The method seemed shockingly simple, so I went ahead and drafted an implementation of
            it. I tested it a few times on my own computer, found that it worked like a charm, and
            then submitted it, only to encounter:
